        <p>Excellent customer service means going beyond meeting your customer’s basic needs.
            It involves much more than providing support in a timely and pleasant manner.
            
            More importantly, it means doing everything possible so your customers are not merely satisfied. 
            They’re actually happy with your products and services.
            
            You need excellent customer service if you want your business to stand out and succeed. 
            Today’s business environment is incredibly fierce. Products compete head-to-head in features. And where products are too similar, it is usually customer service that can tip the scales.
