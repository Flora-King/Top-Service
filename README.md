## TOP-Service
Top Service is a fictious organisation made/set up for the purpose of the code Institute Assessment/project. None the less its website is much live and not fiction.

The Top Service website is a simple and very effective webiste aimed at customers looking to hire qualified professionals to carry out Gardening, Rubbish collection, Laundry, and House Keeping both in their homes or office.

Users of this website are able to find out which services are provided by TOP Service; use the contact details provided to contact TOP service directly; and submit an enquiry using the Enquiry form.

The live website can be found here [Top_service website]: https://flora-king.github.io/Top-Service/
